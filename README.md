### Hi there 👋

My name is Alexandre, I'm a Ruby on Rails developer from France.

The tools I *love* working with are:
- Ruby and Ruby on Rails
- Turbo and Stimulus for sprinkles (✨) of JavaScript 
- Minitest for testing
- CSS and Figma for the design

I started contributing to open source and would love to contribute more in the future.

Here are some of my contributions:
- [rails/rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/commits?author=alexandreruban)
- [hotwired/turbo-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/commits?author=alexandreruban)
- [phlex-ruby/phlex](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/commits?author=alexandreruban)
- [alexandreruban/action-markdown](https://github.com/alexandreruban/action-markdown/commits?author=alexandreruban)

I'm the author of three tutorials:
- [The turbo-rails tutorial](https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails) about how to use the [turbo-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails) gem included by default in Rails 7. 📘
- [The rebuilding turbo-rails tutorial](https://www.hotrails.dev/rebuilding-turbo-rails) where we will rebuild the [turbo-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails) gem by peer coding together. 📕
- [Cookie-based authentication with Ruby on rails](https://www.rubanonrails.com/courses/rails-cookie-authentication) where we learn to use the Rails authentication generator. 🍪
