### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexandre, I'm a Ruby on Rails developer and designer from France.

The tools I *love* working with are:
- Ruby, Ruby on Rails and Hotwire 
- Stimulus for sprinkles (âœ¨) of Javascript 
- Minitest for testing
- CSS and Figma for the design

I started contributing to open source and would love to contribute more in the future.

Here are some of my contributions:
- [hotwired/turbo-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/commits?author=alexandreruban)
- [forem/forem](https://github.com/forem/forem/commits?author=alexandreruban)
